\chapter{Stochastic geometry}\label{ch:2}
\todoo[inline]{Rewrite the introduction}
In the first chapter we have introduced tetrihedrizations as hypergraph structures and defined their energy in terms of the hyperedge potential. Ultimately we want to study their behaviour under some probabilistic assumptions on the distribution of the configuration $\x$. 

This chapter introduces the theory of point processes which will allow us to add stochasticity to the hypergraph structures. The main goal of this chapter is to introduce the Gibbs-type tessellation, where the location of the points are allowed to interact with the geometric properties of the tesssellation, giving us a great freedom in the specification of our models.

\section{Point processes}
In chapter \ref{ch:1} we studied the behaviour of the hypergraph structures for a fixed configuration. In this section, we will shift the view from the configuration as fixed deterministic set to configuration as a particular realization of a ranom point process.
We develop only the bare minimum of the theory of point processes necessary to define and use Gibbs point processes. For a comprehensive introductory text, we recommend \cite{MollerWaagepetersen2003}, as it is most relevant to our case. \newline

\noindent In general, we assume $E$ to be a locally compact separable space. This is the setting in many texts, such as \cite{SchneiderWeil2008}.

The main aim of this text is to build Gibbs point processes with interactions based on the Laguerre tetrihedrizaion. As such, the focus is on marked points and the Delaunay case is treated as secondary. To avoid having a dual marked and unmarked theory, we will treat unmarked point as a special case of marked points in the following way. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Marked case: We take $E=\Rt\times S$ where $S=[0,W],W>0$ is the space of marks. The measure on $E$ is $z\lambda \otimes \mu$, where $\mu$ is a non-atomic probability distribution of marks, $z>0$. 
	\item Unmarked case: We use the same space, but the distribution of marks $\mu=\delta_0$ is now concentrated on $0$.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Basic terms}
\begin{definition}\label{def:measures}
Define a \textit{counting measure} on $E$ as a measure $\nu$ on $E$ for which
$$\nu(B)\in\mathbb N \cup \{0,\infty\}, B\in\mathcal B_0(E)\;\;\text{ and } \; \; \nu(\{x\})\leq 1, x\in E.$$
We say a measure $\nu$ is \textit{locally finite} if $\nu(B)<\infty$ for any $B\in \mathcal  B_0(E)$. Denote $\mathbf N_{lf}(E)$ the space of all locally finite counting measures on $E$.
We equip the space $\mathbf N_{lf}(E)$ with the $\sigma$-algebra
$$\mathcal N_{lf}(E)=\sigma(\{\nu \in \mathbf N_{lf}(E): \nu(B)=n\}: B \in \mathcal B_0(E), n\in \mathbb N_0).$$
Finally we define the set $\mathbf N_f(E) \subset \mathbf N_{lf}(E)$ of finite measures on $E$ by
$$\mathbf N_f(E) = \{\nu \in \mathbf N_{lf}(E): \nu(E)<\infty\}$$
with the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal N_{f}$ defined as the trace $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathbf N_{f}(E)$ on $(\mathbf N_{lf}(E),\mathcal N_{lf}(E))$.
\end{definition}
\todoo[inline]{Define $\mathbf N_\Lambda$}

For the case $E=\Rt\times S$, we use the shortened notation $\mathbf N_{lf}(\Rt\times S) := \mathbf N_{lf}$. Similarly for the terms $\mathbf N_{f}, \mathcal N_{f}, \mathcal N_{lf}, \mathcal B, \mathcal B_0$.
\todoo[inline]{I've dropped the dashed notation, but it's still useful. Use it?}

\unsure[inline]{ Still not quite happy about the measure-set duality. Perhaps $\gamma$ is always a set, $\nu$ a counting measure? Or just use $\gamma$ always, but limit this chapter too treating it as a measure only?}
\begin{remark}[Duality of locally finite counting measures and configurations]
	In chapter 1, we introduced the sets $\mathbf N_{lf}$ and $\mathbf N_f$ as spaces of (finite) configurations --- locally finite sets. This abuse of notation is justified by the fact that there is a measurable bijection between the space of locally finite counting measures (as defined here) and locally finite sets with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on the Fell topology. For details, see lemma 3.1.4. in \cite{SchneiderWeil2008}.   

	Whether a configuration is treated as a set or a counting measure will be clear from the context. With this in mind, we introduce the notation 
	$$x\in \nu \text{ if } \nu(\{x\})=1, \quad \nu \in \mathbf N_{lf}.$$
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
A \textit{point process} on $E$ is a measurable mapping $\Phi:(\Omega,\mathcal A, P) \to (\mathbf N_{lf}(E),\mathcal N_{lf}(E))$. \newline
A \textit{marked point process} $\Phi_m$ is a point process on $\Rt\times S$ for which the projection $\Phi_m(\cdot \times S)$ is a point process on $\Rt$.
\end{definition}
Note that this definition requires the realizations of the projection of the marked point process to be locally finite counting measures in the sense of definition \ref{def:measures}.

\begin{remark}[Simple point process]
	We have defined the counting measure to have values in $\{0,1\}$. Such couting measures, as well as the point processes defined through them, are commonly called \textit{simple}. We do not need this distinction here, therefore we do not use the term.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Poisson point process}
Perhaps the most important example of a point process is the Poisson point process which formalizes the notion of a complete spatial randomness. Before we define the Poisson point process, we first define a process closely related it.

\begin{definition} Let $\nu$ be a measure on $E$, $B \in \mathcal B_0(E)$ such that $0<\nu(B)<\infty$. For $n\in \mathbb N$ let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ be independent and $\nu$-uniformly distributed random variables on $B$, that is
	$$P(X_i \in A) = \frac{\nu(A)}{\nu(B)},\; A\in\mathcal B(E), A \subset B$$
Then we define the \textit{binomial point process} of $n$ points in $B$ as
$$\Phi(n) = \sum^{n}_{i=1}  \delta_{X_i}.$$
We use the convention $\sum^0_{i=1} \delta_{X_i} = \varnothing$, where $\varnothing(E)=0$ is the \textit{empty point process}.
\end{definition}
In the marked case, $X_i=(X'_i,M_i)$ where $X'_i$ is the position and $M_i$ the mark of $X_i$ and we can write
$$\Phi(n) = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \delta_{(X'_i,M_i)}.$$
However, similarly to chapter 1, we only specify the marks where needed, as this approach leads to a cleaner notation. 

\todoo[inline]{Improve the connnection of $\nu$ to the process}
\begin{proposition}\label{bincalc}
	Let $\Phi_n = \sum^{n}_{i=1}  \delta_{X_i}$ be a binomial point process on $B\in\mathcal B_0(E)$ with the measure $\nu$. Then for a non-negative measurable $f$ we have
\begin{equation}\label{binom}
	Ef(X_1,\dots, X_k) = \frac 1{\nu(B)^k} \int_B \cdots \int_B f(x_1,\dots, x_k) \nu(dx_1) \cdots \nu(dx_k), \quad k = 1,\dots, n
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
From the definition of $\Phi_n$, we have for Borel $A_i \subset B, i=1,\dots,k$ that
\begin{align*}
P(X_1 \in A_1, \dots, X_k \in A_k) &= P(X_1\in A_1)\cdots P(X_k\in A_k) \\ 
& = \frac 1{\nu(B)^k} \int_B \cdots \int_B 1_{A_1}(x_1) \cdots 1_{A_k}(x_k) \nu(dx_1) \cdots \nu(dx_k) \\
\end{align*}
That is \ref{binom} for $f(x_1,\dots,x_k)=1_{A_1}(x_1)\dots 1_{A_k}(x_k)$. By a standard argument, we first extend this to a general set $C \in \mathcal B^k(E), C\subset B^k$ using the Dynkin system 
$$\{C \in \mathcal B^k(E): E 1_C (x_1,\dots,x_k) = \int \cdots \int 1_C(x_1,\dots, x_k) dx_1 \cdots dx_k \}$$
 and then from indicators to any non-negative measurable function.
\end{proof}




\begin{definition} Let $\nu=$ be a measure on $E$. A point process $\Phi$ satisfying
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\Phi(B)$ has a Poisson distribution with parameter $\nu(B)$ for each $B\in \mathcal B_0(E)$,
	\item Conditonally on $\Phi_B=n, n\in\mathbb N$,  $\Phi|_B$ is the Binomial point process of $n$ points in $B$, $B \in \mathcal B_0(E)$.
\end{enumerate}
is a \textit{Poisson process} on $E$ with \textit{intesity measure} $\nu$.
For $B\in \mathcal B_0(E)$, denote $\Pi^\nu_B$ the distribution of a Poisson point process with intensity measure $\nu$ restricted to $B$.  
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}We define the \textit{marked Poisson process} is a Poisson process on $\Rt\times S$ with intensity measure $z\lambda \otimes \mu$. We call the parameter $z$ the \textit{intensity}.\newline
	For $\Lambda\in \mathcal B_0(\Rt)$, denote $\Pi^z_\Lambda$ the distribution of a marked Poisson point process with intensity $z\lambda \otimes \mu$ restricted to $\Lambda\times S$. For $z=1$, we lose the $z$ and denote the distribution simply $\Pi_\Lambda$.
\end{definition}

\unsure[inline]{We could also define $\Pi_\Lambda$ as the marginal, without marks. Think this through}

Note that thanks to \ref{bincalc} we have for a marked Poisson process $\Phi$ with intensity $z$ and $\Gamma \in \mathcal N_{lf}$ 

\begin{align}\label{eq:poiscalc}
	\Pi^z_\Lambda(\Gamma) &= P(\Phi \in \Gamma) = \sum^\infty_{k=0} P(\Phi \in \Gamma | \Phi(\Lambda) = k) P(\Phi(\Lambda)=k) \\
	& = \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(z|\Lambda|)^k}{k!} e^{-z|\Lambda|} P(\Phi^{(k)}\in \Gamma) \nonumber \\ 
	& = \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{z^k}{k!} e^{-z|\Lambda|} \int_{\Lambda\times S} \cdots \int_{\Lambda\times S} 1_{\Gamma} \left(\sum^k_{i=1} \delta_{X_i}\right) \nu(dx_1), \dots, \nu(dx_k) \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\Phi^{(k)} = \sum^k_{i=1}\delta_{(X_i,M_i)}$ denotes the Binomial point process of $k$ points in $C$ and $\nu=\lambda \otimes \mu$. 

\begin{remark}[Points in general position]
	In section \ref{sec:tetrahedrizations} we introduced the sets $\mathbf N_{gp}$ and $\mathbf N_{rgp}$. In \cite{Zessin2008}, it is proved\footnote{This fact seems to have been generally accepted as true in the literature for decades, yet --- as far as we are aware --- no formal proof was ever published until 2008.} that these sets are measurable and that for $\Lambda \in \mathcal B_0(\Rt)$
	$$\Pi^z_{\Lambda}(\mathbf N_{gp}) = \Pi^z_{\Lambda}(\mathbf N_{rgp})=0.$$
\end{remark}

\subsection{Finite point processes with density}
\todoo[inline]{Maybe we should use $\mathbf N_\Lambda$ instead of $\mathbf N_f$. Check this}
A standard approach in probability theory is to define random variables with distributions absolutely continuous with respect to some reference measure. In Euclidean spaces, the reference measure is typically the Lebesgue or counting measure. In the space $(\mathbf N_{lf},\mathcal N_{lf})$ the convenient properties of the Poisson point process make it the perfect candidate for the reference measure. In this chapter, we will restrict ourselves only to the space $(\mathbf N_f,\mathcal N_f)$ of finite counting measures.
\todoo[inline]{ Why Poisson is the best}
In this chapter, we limit ourselves entirely to the case $E=\Rt \times S$. At the same time, we will stop using the term ``marked'' where we deem it redundant. 

\begin{definition}
We say that a point process $\Psi$ on $\Rt \times S$ \textit{has the density $p$} with respect to the Poisson process if its distribution is absolutely continuous w.r.t. $\Pi_\Lambda$ with density function $p$. That is there exists a measurable function $p: \mathbf N_f \to \mathbb R^+$ such that $\int p(\gamma) \Pi_\Lambda (\gamma)=1$ and
$$P(\Psi \in \Gamma) = \int_\Gamma p(\gamma) \Pi_\Lambda(d\gamma), \; \Gamma \in \mathcal N_{f}$$
\end{definition}

\todoo[inline]{Make the calculations clearer, they're a bit scattered now}
Notice that using the calculations in proposition \ref{bincalc} and \ref{eq:poiscalc} we have
$$
P(\Psi \in \Gamma) = \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{1}{k!} e^{-|\Lambda|} \int_{\Lambda\times S} \cdots \int_{\Lambda\times S} 1_{\Gamma} \left(\sum^k_{i=1} \delta_{X_i}\right) p\left(\sum^k_{i=1} \delta_{X_i}\right) \nu(dx_1) \dots \nu(dx_k)
$$
where $\nu=\lambda\otimes \mu$.
	The equation above is a special case of 
$$Eh(\Psi)=Eh(\Phi)p(\Phi)$$
for $\Pi_\Lambda$-measurable function $h$, where $\Phi \sim \Pi_\Lambda$.

A useful function for dealing with point processes with density is the Papangelou conditional intensity.
\begin{definition}
	For  a point process $\Phi$ with density $p$ we define the \textit{Papangelou conditonal intensity} as 
	$$\lambda^*(x,\gamma) = \frac{p(\gamma + \delta_x)}{p(\gamma)}, \; x \in \Rt \times S, \gamma \in \mathbf N_{f}: p(\gamma)>0.$$
\end{definition}

An example of a point process with a density, albeit uninteresting, is the Poisson process with intensity $z$.\newline
Denote the \textit{counting function} for $\Lambda \in \mathcal B_0(\Rt)$ and $\gamma \in \mathbf N_{lf}$:
$$N_\Lambda(\gamma) = \gamma(\Lambda \times S)$$ 

\begin{proposition} $\Pi_\Lambda^z \ll \Pi_\Lambda$ with density $p(\gamma)=z^{N_\Lambda(\gamma)} \exp(|\Lambda|(1-z))$, $\gamma \in \mathbf \mathbf N_{\Lambda}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Denote $\Phi \sim \Pi_\Lambda$, we have for $\Gamma\in \mathcal N_{f}$, using proposition \ref{bincalc} and \ref{eq:poiscalc}
	$$\Pi^z_\Lambda(\Gamma) = E(1_\Gamma(\Phi)  z^{|\Phi|} e^{|\Lambda|} e^{-z|\Lambda|}) $$
\end{proof}


\subsection{Gibbs Point Processes}
\todoo[inline]{This section is underdeveloped}
At the end of the last section we have found that $\Pi^z_\Lambda \ll \Pi_\Lambda$ with the density $p(\gamma) \propto z^{N_\Lambda(\gamma)}$. The introduction of the Gibbs point process is outwardly simple, since we merely add an additional term containing the energy function from definition \ref{def:energy}, so that the density is proportional to the expression
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GPPdensity}z^{N_\Lambda(\gamma)} e^{-H_\Lambda (\gamma)}.\end{equation}
By this seemingly small alteration we introduce a great complexity into the structure of the resulting process. Before we proceed with the formal definition of (finite) Gibbs point processes, we must impose some additional assumptions on the energy function.


\subsubsection{The energy function}

Thanks to the energy function, we can force the realizations of the finite GPP to obey a diverse set of geometrical properties. In our case those geometrical properties come through the hyperedge structures $\mathcal D$ and $\mathcal {LD}$, see example \ref{ex:potentials}. \newline

In the following, we restrict ourselves to $\mathbf N_f$ and for $\gamma \in \mathbf N_f$ we denote $H(\gamma):= H_\Rt(\gamma)$.\newline 

\noindent Traditionally, the energy function is required to satisfy some assumptions. Here we list those from \cite{Dereudre2017}. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Non-degeneracy}:\unsure{I don't really understand the role of $\emptyset$ in Gibbs theory.}
		$$H(\varnothing) < +\infty.$$
	\item \textbf{Hereditarity}: For any $\gamma \in \mathbf N_f$ and $x\in \gamma$
		$$H(\gamma)< + \infty \Rightarrow H(\gamma - \delta_x) < +\infty.$$
	\item \textbf{Stability}: there exists a constant $c_S\geq 0$ such that for any $\gamma \in \mathbf N_f$
		$$H(\gamma) \geq c_S\cdot N_\Rt (\gamma).$$
\end{itemize}
Recall also that we assumed all potentials to be shift-invariant and thus any energy function inherits this property.\newline

Stability bounds the density function $p(\gamma) \propto z^{N_\Lambda( \gamma)}e^{-H(\gamma)} \leq (z e^{-c_S})^{N_\Lambda(\gamma)} $ and thus ensures $Z^z_\Lambda < \infty$. Integrability of the density is obviously a necessary assumption and thus some form of stability cannot be avoided. 
Non-degeneracy, when paired with hereditarity, is a very natural assumption; without it, hereditarity would imply that the energy is always infinite.\newline

The form \ref{eq:GPPdensity} of the density function suggests that the resulting distitribution will favor configurations with low energy. Configurations with high energy are unlikely to happen and an infinite energy means that the configuration is not possible under the distribution. We call such a configuration \textit{forbidden}. A configuration that is not forbidden is \textit{allowed}.  \newline

Hereditarity ensures that removing a point will not result in a forbidden configuration. Equivalently it ensures that adding a point to a forbidden configuration will not result in an allowed configuration. This assumption is, however, not necessarily satisfied by our models. Take for example the hard-core exclusion potential from \ref{ex:potentials}. Removing a point can lead to appearance of a tetrahedron with a larger circumdiameter, thus resulting in a forbidden configuration.\newline

Unlike non-degeneracy or hereditarity, it is not immediately clear what the role of hereditarity is. Luckily for us, it means that we can define Gibbs point processes without the assumption and only then explore its function.



\subsubsection{Finite volume Gibbbs measures}

\begin{definition}\label{def:fGPP}
	Let $\mathcal E$ be a hyperedge structure and $H$ an energy function on $\mathcal E$ such that $H$ is non-degenerate and stable. The \textit{finite Gibbs measure} on $\Lambda\in \mathcal B_0(\Rt)$ with activity $z>0$ is the distribution $P^z_\Lambda$ such that $P^z_\Lambda \ll \Pi_\Lambda$ with density
	$$p(\gamma) = \frac 1{Z^{z}_\Lambda} z^{\gamma(\Lambda)} e^{-H(\gamma)},\quad \gamma \in \mathbf N_f,$$
where  $Z^z_\Lambda = \int z^{N_\Lambda} e^{-H} \Pi_\Lambda$ is the normalizing constant, called \textit{partition function}. \newline
The point process with the distribution $P^z_{\Lambda}$ is called the \textit{finite Gibbs point process} (finite GPP). 
\end{definition}

An important characterization are the \textbf{Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle} (\textbf{DLR}) \textbf{equations}.

\begin{proposition}
	Let $\Delta,\Lambda\in \mathcal B_0(\Rt)$ with $\Delta \subset \Lambda$. Then for $P^z_{\Lambda}$-a.s. all $\gamma_{\Delta^c}$
	$$P^z_{\Lambda}(d\gamma_\Delta|\gamma_{\Delta^c}) = \frac 1{Z^z_\Delta(\gamma_{\Delta^c})} z^{N_\Delta(\gamma)} e^{-H_\Delta(\gamma)} \Pi_\Delta (d\gamma_\Delta),$$
		where $Z^z_{\Delta}(\gamma_{\Delta^c}) = \int z^{N_\Delta(\gamma)} e^{-H_\Delta(\gamma)} \Pi_\Delta(d\gamma_\Delta)$ is the normalizing constant. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}.
		\problem[inline]{As of now, this is \textbf{not} the same as \cite{Dereudre2017}, since we have a different local energy. However, we can probably adapt the proof using lemma \ref{lemma:DL07}. Do so later.}
\end{proof}

The DLR equations express the conditional probability of configurations inside the window $\Delta$, given the configuration outside it.

\todoo[inline]{Comment on DLR. Condtiional probability. Normalizing constant. Possibly integral form?}


\subsubsection{Infinite volume Gibbs measures}
As noted in section \ref{sec:hypergraphs}, without extra assumptions on $\gamma$, such as the range confinement, the energy $H$ may not be well-defined. We will therefore restrict our definition of infinite volume Gibbs measures, or simply Gibbs measures, only to configurations $\gamma$ such that $\gamma \in N^\Lambda_{cr}$ for every $\Lambda \in \mathcal B_0(\Rt)$. We will learn in proposition \ref{prop:cr-a.s.} that this restriction does not limit us in any way.

First, we define $\Theta=(\vartheta_x)_{x\in \Rt}$ be the translation group define by the translations $\vartheta_x$ from definition \ref{def:potential}. Let $\mathcal P_\Theta$ denote the set of all $\Theta$-invariant probability measures on $(\mathbf N_{lf},\mathcal N_{lf})$ with $\int N_{[0,1]^3 \times S} dP< \infty $ \todoo{maybe connect this to intensity, i.e. define intensity etc}. 

\begin{definition}
	Let $\mathcal E$ be a hypergraph structure and $H$ an energy function on $\mathcal E$ such that $H$ is non-degenerate and stable. A probability measure $P\in \mathcal P_\Theta$ on $(\mathbf N_{lf},\mathcal N_{lf})$ is the \textit{Gibbs measure} with activity $z>0$ if $P(\mathbf N^\Lambda_{cr})=1$ and
	$$\int f dP = \int_{\mathbf N^\Lambda_{cr}} \frac 1 {Z^z_{\Lambda}(\gamma)} \int_{\mathbf N_\Lambda} f(\zeta \cup \gamma_{\Lambda^c}) e^{H_{\Lambda,\gamma}(\zeta)} \Pi^z_\Lambda (d\zeta) P(d\gamma)$$
		for every $\Lambda \in \mathcal B_0(\Rt)$ and every measurable $f:\mathbf N_{lf} \to [0,\infty)$.
\end{definition}

The definition is a direct analogue of the DLR equations for finite GPP. In fact it is the same relationship, only expressed in integral form \todoo{Actually explain this}

While defining the Gibbs measure is relative straight-forward, proving its existence is not. The existence and uniqueness of Gibbs measures is an active field of research and one where we still currently do not know much, particularly in case of uniqueness. The non-uniqueness is a consequence of the fact that the existence of a Gibbs measure is typically proven only through proving tightness of a sequence of finite Gibbs measures, thus yielding only a convergent subsequence. We will not delve into the topic any further here and we refer the reader to an introductory text \cite{Dereudre2017} and the paper on which we base the proof of existence for our models, \cite{DDG12}. We also recommend reading the introduction to \cite{Georgii2011} --- although the book is about Gibbs random fields rather than point processes, the introduction gives an intuitive explanation for the form of the density and in particular the connection of the non-uniqueness with phase transitions.


\subsubsection{Hereditary GPP}
One of the disadvantages of the characterization through DLR equations is the presence of the normalization constant, as it is, in most cases, unknown. This is where the use of the hereditarity assumption comes in. 

For $\gamma \in \mathbf N_f$ and $x \in \Rt\times S$, define the \textit{local energy} of $x$ in $\gamma$ as
$$h(x,\gamma) = H(\gamma + \delta_x) - H(\gamma),$$
with the convention $+\infty - (+\infty) = 0$. Notice that for $\gamma \in \mathbf N_f$ such that $p(\gamma) > 0$, where $p$ is now the density of a finite GPP, we have
$$\lambda^*(x,\gamma) = z \cdot e^{-h(x,\gamma)}.$$
\todoo[inline]{Talk about the fact that it's well-defined thanks to range confinement}

We then obtain the following result, known as the \textbf{Georgii-Nguyen-Zessin }(\textbf{GNZ})\textbf{equations}. 

\begin{proposition} Let $P$ be a Gibbs measure and $\Lambda \in \mathcal B(\Rt)$ such that $|\Lambda|>0$. For any non-negative measurable function $f$ from $(\Rt\times S)\times \mathbf N_{lf}$ to $\mathbb R$,
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:GNZ}\int \sum_{x \in \gamma} f(x,\gamma- \delta_x) P(d\gamma) = z \int \int_{\Lambda\times S} f(x,\gamma) e^{-h(x,\gamma)} dx P (d\gamma).\end{equation}
	Furthermore $P^z_\Lambda$ is uniquely defined by \ref{eq:GNZ} in the sense that if a probability measure $P$ on $\mathbf N_f$ satisfies \ref{eq:GNZ}, then $P=P^z_\Lambda$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	\unsure[inline]{Adapt theorem 2 in sectino 2.5. from \cite{Dereudre2017}?}
\end{proof}

Hereditarity thus gives us a powerful characterization of the finite Gibbs measure. Possibly even more important is that a number of estimation techniques (maximum pseudolikelihood used here being one of them) make use the Papangelou conditional intensity and GNZ equations, thus the presence of non-hereditarity provides a direct obstacle to estimation.
 

Luckily, the approach in \unsure{Possibly cite the later edition? What's the approach here?} \cite{DereudreLavancier2007} allows us to directly use GNZ equations even for the non-hereditary case.

% 


\subsubsection{Non-hereditary}
Having defined the Gibbs measure, we can now continue to present the approach of \cite{DereudreLavancier2007} extending the GNZ equations to Gibbs point processes with non-hereditary energy functions.

Define $\mathbf N_\infty$
$$\mathbf N_\infty = \{\x \in \mathbf N_{lf}: \forall \Lambda \in B_0(\Rt): H_\Lambda(\x)< \infty\}$$
\unsure[inline]{Measurability?}

\begin{definition}
	Let $\gamma \in \mathbf N_\infty$. We say $x\in\gamma$ is \textit{removable} if 
	$$\text{there exist } \Lambda \in \mathcal B(\Rt) \text{ such that } x\in\Lambda \text{ and } H_\Lambda(\gamma - \delta_x)<\infty$$
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:DL07}
	There exists a measurable function $\psi_{\Delta,\Lambda}:\mathbf N_{lf}\to \mathbb R\cup\{+\infty\}$ such that
	$$\forall \gamma \in \mathbf N_{lf},\quad H_\Lambda(\gamma) = H_\Delta(\gamma) + \psi_{\Delta,\Lambda}(\gamma_{\Delta^c})$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	To find such function, we only need to realize that
	$$H_\Lambda(\gamma) - H_\Delta(\gamma) = \sum_{\eta \in \mathcal E_\Lambda(\gamma) \setminus \mathcal E_\Delta(\gamma)} \varphi(\eta,\gamma)$$
	depends only on $\gamma_{\Delta^c}$. As noted below the definition \ref{def:Eset}, both $\mathcal E_\Delta(\gamma)$ and $\mathcal E_\Lambda(\gamma)$ depend only on $\gamma$ outside the window $\Lambda$ and $\Delta$ respectivelly.By $\eta \notin \mathcal E_{\Delta}(\gamma)$ we have that $\forall \zeta \in \mathbf N_\Delta: \varphi(\eta,\gamma)=\varphi(\eta,\zeta \cup \gamma_{\Delta^c})$ and thus we can set
	$$\psi_{\Delta,\Lambda}(\gamma_{\Delta^c}) = \sum_{\eta \in \mathcal E_\Lambda(\gamma_{\Delta^c}) \setminus \mathcal E_\Delta(\gamma_{\Delta^c})} \varphi(\eta,\gamma_{\Delta^c}).$$
\end{proof}

\todoo[inline]{Say what the set is equal to for us}


\begin{proposition}
	Let $\gamma \in \mathbf N_\infty$, then $x\in\gamma$ is removable if and only if $\gamma - \delta_x \in \mathbf N_\infty$.

	where $\Lambda \in \mathcal B_0(\Rt)$
\end{definition}
Let us remark that such set always exists by definition and that the value of $h(x,\gamma-\delta_x)$ does not depend on the choice of $\Lambda$ as a consequence of $\ref{lemma:DL07}$.


\begin{proposition}
	Let $P$ be a stationary Gibbs measure. For every bounded non-negative measurable $f:(\Rt\times S) \times \mathbf N_{lf}\to\mathbb R$ we have
	$$\int 1_{\mathbf N_\infty}(\gamma) \sum_{x \in \gamma} f(x,\gamma -\delta_x) P(d\gamma) = z \int \int f(x,\gamma)e^{-h(x,\gamma)} dx P(d\gamma).$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	See proposition $2$ \unsure{But what about marks, does it work?}in \cite{DereudreLavancier2007}.
\end{proof}

Note that we lose the converse implication. That is the GNZ equations no longer characterize Gibbs point process with non-hereditary energy function. Imagine a measure $P$ under which $\gamma$ a.s. does not contain any removable points. The equation then becomes the trivial equation $0=0$.
