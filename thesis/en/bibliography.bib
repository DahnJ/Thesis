abstract="We establish the existence of stationary Gibbsian point processes for interactions that act on hyperedges between the points. For example, such interactions can depend on Delaunay edges or triangles, cliques of Voronoi cells or clusters of k-nearest neighbors. The classical case of pair interactions is also included. The basic tools are an entropy bound and stationarity.",

As a consequence we show that Poisson processes P$\rho$with an infinite intensity measures $\rho$ are in general position iff $\rho$ is diffuse in the sense that any affine subspace of dimension d - 1 is a $\rho$-nullset. Moreover, P$\rho$is in reinforced general position iff in addition any (d - 1)-sphere is a $\rho$-nullset.",

abstract="A set ofn weighted points in general position in Rddefines a unique regular triangulation. This paper proves that if the points are added one by one, then flipping in a topological order will succeed in constructing this triangulation. If, in addition, the points are added in a random sequence and the history of the flips is used for locating the next point, then the algorithm takes expected time at mostO(nlogn+n[d/2]). Under the assumption that the points and weights are independently and identically distributed, the expected running time is between proportional to and a factor logn more than the expected size of the regular triangulation. The expectation is over choosing the points and over independent coin-flips performed by the algorithm.",

It is shown that, when k and d are fixed and n grows without bound, the expected number of k-dimensional faces grows as Ck,dn. Further, for fixed k as d grows without bound, there exist constants ak such that Ck,d = O(adk). Numerical estimates of Ck,d are given for small values of k and d.

Untersucht wird der asymptotische Verhalten der Erwartungszahl der Seiten aller Dimensionen des von n unabhängigen in Rd gleichverteilten Punkten gebildeten Voronoi-Diagramms. Für beliebige k und d und grenzlos ansteigendes n wird bewiesen, daß die Erwartungszahl der k-dimensionellen Seiten wie Ck,dn ansteigt. Ferner, für beliebiges k und grenzlos ansteigendes d gibt es solche Konstante ak, daß Ck,d = O(adk). Für kleine Werte von k und d werden numerische Schätzungen von Ck,d gegeben."
