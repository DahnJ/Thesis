\def\Dedication{%
I would like to thank my supervisor prof. RNDr. Viktor Bene\v{s}, DrSc. for all the time and effort he put into helping me on the often thorny path of writing this thesis. I am also grateful for all the opportunities he provided me with to present and discuss my work on seminars and conferences.

If there is one other person without whom this thesis would have been much more difficult to write, it is my partner, Adela Nguy$\tilde{\hat{e}}$n. I am grateful for having her by my side throughout the whole process of writing this thesis. She has far surpassed the official requirements for the partner of a mathematician, that is to be emotionally supportive and understanding, especially when waking up in the middle of the night to find the said mathematician working, again. She has spent countless hours listening to me talk about circles and tetrahedrons and, on several occasions, picked up a pen and paper and actively helped me solve the problems. Thank you for everything.

For helping me with a difficult programming language I knew nothing about, as well as for general advice on programming, I thank my friend and an excellent programmer Jan Noha.

I thank Colin Beet for helping me improve the linguistic aspects of this thesis. He would like the reader to know that, contrary to what Remark \ref{r:abuse} claims, abuse of any kind can never be justified.

I thank my family for supporting my academic endeavours even though they still have no idea what it is I am actually doing. 

Finally, I'd like to thank the following people who have provided valuable insights and comments: Prof. David Dereudre, Jeremy Tan, Mat\v{e}j Kov\'{a}\v{r}, Prof. Volker Schmidt, Prof. David Eppstein.

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
	The past few years have seen advances in modelling of polycrystalline materials using parametric tessellation models from stochastic geometry. A promising class of tessellations, the Gibbs-type tessellation, allows the user to specify a great variety of properties through the energy function. 
	This text focuses solely on Gibbs-type tetrahedrizations, a three-dimensional tessellation composed of tetrahedra. The existing results for two-dimensional Delaunay triangulations are extended to the case of three-dimensional Laguerre tetrahedrization. We provide a proof of existence, a \texttt{C++} implementation of the MCMC simulation and estimation of the models parameters through maximum pseudolikelihood.
